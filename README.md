# second-brain-project (codename)

> **Private workspace for the Go port of GitCurator** — the personal second-brain library
> builder (Python/PyQt6 → Go). Codename until the branded name is chosen; stays private
> until launch.

**Status: Phase 0 executed** — SESSION-001 (proofs & baselines) owner-confirmed
2026-10-15; PoC verdicts recorded (Wails ✅, tls-client ✅, gotd/td provisional — the
owner-assisted login leg is SESSION-002's first order of business), harness skeleton +
Python baselines archived. Next: **SESSION-002 = T-01 completion + Phase 1
(pure-foundation packages)**, per the roadmap.

## Map

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| **HOW SESSIONS WORK (start here)** | [`docs/SESSION-PROTOCOL.md`](docs/SESSION-PROTOCOL.md) — the loop every session follows |
| **The state card / next prompt** | [`docs/NEXT-SESSION.md`](docs/NEXT-SESSION.md) — rewritten at every session close |
| **Session reports (the history)** | [`docs/sessions/`](docs/sessions/) — numbered SESSION-NNN.md files |
| The complete migration blueprint (73 docs) | [`docs/port-blueprint/`](docs/port-blueprint/) — start at its `README.md`, then `00-executive-summary.md` |
| The mission spec that produced the blueprint | [`docs/Port-investigation.md`](docs/Port-investigation.md) |
| App icon (ready-made brand mark, multi-size) | [`assets/icons/gitcurator.ico`](assets/icons/gitcurator.ico) — swap the file later to rebrand |
| Owner decisions (all Q&A rounds) | `docs/port-blueprint/14-risks-assumptions-open-questions.md` §6 |

> **Starting a new work session?** Open a fresh AI chat and paste the prompt from
> `docs/NEXT-SESSION.md` §5. That's the whole workflow.

## The goal in one paragraph

A single Windows executable (Go engine + Wails GUI) that behaves byte-identically to the
Python app, opens the owner's real data in place, and fixes the sluggishness: cold start
≤ 1.5 s, vault scan ≤ 50% of Python, idle memory ≤ 200 MB. Delivered as both a
`setup.exe` (silent WebView2 bootstrap when missing) and a deterministic portable zip.
The unmodified Python reference repo (`assadigit/GitCurator`, pinned rev — at blueprint
time v0.91.0 / `8fd4179`) stays the live product until Go GUI parity, and is never
modified by this migration; differential tests run both apps side by side.

## Laws (binding, from the blueprint)

- Reality wins over specs: when source code contradicts a spec, fix the spec in the same commit.
- No visual redesign during the port — replicate the documented design (ADR-0001).
- Preserve observable behavior, including quirks; only the five pre-classified fixes are allowed.
- Never commit credentials, session files, or the owner's real `config.json` / `cache.db`.
- Tests are never weakened, skipped, or deleted to get green.
